        <p class="indent">For the fig-swirl: Melt butter over medium heat in a saucepan. Add brown sugar and stir to
            dissolve. halve all of the figs and toss in the saucepan with water and lemon juice. Cook over medium heat,
            stirring frequently, until you have a chunky-jammy mixture. Add salt with one or two stirs, set aside and
            let cool completely.</p>

        <p class="indent"> Ice cream: In a small pot over medium heat, combine milk, and granulated sugar until sugar is
            completely dissolved adn the milk is just barely lukewarm. Whisk in the egg yolks. Set mixture in the fridge
            and wait until the fig mixture is cooled. </p>

        <p class="indent"> Using an ice cream machine, pur liquids into the frozen basin and process according to
            manufacturer instructions, i.e., let spin and thicken for 20 minutes before adding mascarpone, fig jam
            mixture, and the nuts. Continue to process for +/- 10 minutes. Pour semi-frozen mixture into a pyrex dish or
            glass tupperware. Freeze for at least two hours before serving. </p>
